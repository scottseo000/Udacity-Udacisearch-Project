# Project: Parallel Web Crawler

![UdaciSearch Logo](UdaciSearch.png)

Welcome! This is your first week at the startup, **UdaciSearch**. You've been hired on as an Engineer, and you're really excited to make a big splash. UdaciSearch is interested in figuring out popular search terms on the internet in order to improve the [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) of their clients. Everyone wants to pop up at the top of a potential user's search! 

You are given the source code for your company's legacy web crawler, which is single-threaded. You notice it's a bit slow, and you quickly realize a way to improve its performance and impress your new manager. You can upgrade the code to take advantage of multi-core architectures to increase crawler throughput. Furthermore, you will measure the performance of your crawler to prove that, given the same amount of time, the multi-threaded implementation can visit more web pages than the legacy implementation. It might just be your first week, but you're set to impress!
